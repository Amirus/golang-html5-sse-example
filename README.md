Golang HTML5 SSE Example
========================

This is an minimalistic example of how to do
[HTML5 Server Side Events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events)
with [Go (golang)](http://golang.org/).

## Installing

Check out the repository from GitHub

	git clone https://github.com/kljensen/golang-html5-sse-example

## Running

To run the server, do 

	go run ./server.go

Then point your web browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Thanks

This code is based off of a few sources, mostly

* [Leroy Campbell's SSE example in Go](https://gist.github.com/artisonian/3836281); and,
* the [HTML5Rocks SSE tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/).
